## 🏗️ How It Works  
1. 🛸 The program welcomes the user to **Address Odyssey** and asks for their **full name**.  
2. 🏡 The user enters details for their **billing address**, including:  
   - 🏠 **Street Address**  
   - 🏙️ **City**  
   - 🌎 **State**  
   - 🔢 **Zip Code**  
3. 🧹 **The system clears the input buffer** to ensure smooth data handling.  
4. 🚚 The user then enters their **shipping address** using the same format.  
5. 🎨 The system processes inputs, builds a **formatted address blueprint**, and displays it.
