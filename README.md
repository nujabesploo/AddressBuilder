# 🏠 Address Builder: Your Personal Address Vault  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Address Builder** is a Java-based console application that collects, formats, and displays **billing and shipping addresses** with a seamless user experience. It ensures well-structured output while keeping the interaction engaging.

## ⚡ Features  
✨ **Guided User Input** – Step-by-step prompts for entering name, billing, and shipping addresses 📝  
⚡ **Optimized Address Formatting** – Uses `StringBuilder` for efficient string manipulation 🔧  
🛑 **Input Buffer Clearing** – Prevents input mismatches for a smooth flow 🚀  
📦 **Structured Address Output** – Displays billing and shipping details in a readable format 🏗️  

---

## 🏗️ How It Works  
1. 🛸 The program welcomes the user to **Address Odyssey** and asks for their **full name**.  
2. 🏡 The user enters details for their **billing address**, including:  
   - 🏠 **Street Address**  
   - 🏙️ **City**  
   - 🌎 **State**  
   - 🔢 **Zip Code**  
3. 🧹 **The system clears the input buffer** to ensure smooth data handling.  
4. 🚚 The user then enters their **shipping address** using the same format.  
5. 🎨 The system processes inputs, builds a **formatted address blueprint**, and displays it.
